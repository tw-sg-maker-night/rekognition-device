# AWS Rekognition with Webcam?

Maybe using Raspberry pi with webcam and motion sensor to capture faces and compare it with our S3 bucket `rekognition-people`

## Some environment variables you may need
```
  //fixed settings
  AWS_REGION=us-east-1
  AWS_COLLECTION_ID=rekognition-people
  SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=75

  LOCAL_DIRECTORY=/path/to/your/file/dir
```

## Get Started
1. npm start
2. go to `localhost:3000`


## AWS CLI Commands to manage Faces
Doesn't seem like there's a way to do it via the AWS Management (or maybe I can't find it)

0. Upload your image to S3 bucket: `rekognition-people`
1. List collections
    `aws rekognition list-collections`
2. (If no collection found) Create a collection
    `aws rekognition create-collection --collection-id "rekognition-people"`
3. List faces
    `aws rekognition list-faces --collection-id rekognition-people`
4. Add Faces to collection
    ```
    aws rekognition index-faces \
    --image '{"S3Object":{"Bucket":"rekognition-people","Name":"Donnie-Yen.jpeg"}}' \
    --collection-id "rekognition-people"
    ```

5. Delete Faces from collection
    ```
    aws rekognition delete-faces \
    --face-ids "id1,id2" \
    --collection-id "rekognition-people"
    ```

## Notes
CollectionArn: aws:rekognition:us-east-1:623790533772:collection/rekognition-people
AWS BUCKET: rekognition-people
